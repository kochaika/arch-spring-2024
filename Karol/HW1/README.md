Unfortunately, I fell seriously ill at the end of last week and barely managed to prepare everything for my thesis. What I provided was some hastily prepared sketchesâ€”I would have liked to do more, but time did not favor me.

Currently, there is a rough draft of the system in C++, where a machine with memory will be emulated. A part of the parsing has been written in Kotlin, where cases for recognizing different blocks of high-level commands and mapping them to corresponding binary commands have already been processed.
